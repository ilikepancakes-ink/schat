# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

Schat is designed with security as a primary concern, especially given its target audience. This document outlines our security measures, reporting procedures, and best practices.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based authentication** with secure token management
- **Password hashing** using bcrypt with salt rounds
- **Session management** with automatic token expiration
- **Role-based access control** (Site Owner, Admin, Moderator, User)

### Data Protection
- **Input validation** on all user inputs to prevent injection attacks
- **SQL injection protection** through parameterized queries
- **XSS protection** with proper output encoding
- **CSRF protection** with token validation
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse and DoS attacks

### Communication Security
- **HTTPS enforcement** in production environments
- **Secure WebSocket connections** for real-time messaging
- **Message encryption** for sensitive communications
- **Privacy settings** for user profiles and messaging

### Infrastructure Security
- **Environment variable protection** for sensitive configuration
- **Database security** with proper access controls
- **API endpoint protection** with authentication middleware
- **Error handling** that doesn't expose sensitive information

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We welcome security researchers and ethical hackers to help us improve our security posture. We have multiple channels for reporting security issues:

### In-Application Reporting (Preferred)
1. Visit the application homepage
2. Click the **"Hackers? Visit here!"** button
3. Fill out the security report form with:
   - Vulnerability description
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested remediation (if any)
4. Submit the report

Reports submitted through this system are automatically forwarded to our security team via Discord webhook.

### Direct Contact
For critical vulnerabilities that require immediate attention or if the forms broken for the 50th time:
- **Email**: [webmaster@ilikepancakes.ink]
- **Discord**: [send me a dm user: ilikepancakes.ink]

### What to Include in Your Report
- **Vulnerability Type**: (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection, Authentication Bypass)
- **Affected Components**: Specific pages, APIs, or features
- **Reproduction Steps**: Clear, step-by-step instructions
- **Proof of Concept**: Screenshots, code snippets, or demo videos
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential consequences of the vulnerability
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have recommendations for remediation

## ‚ö° Response Timeline

We are committed to addressing security issues promptly:

- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Response within 24 hours, fix within 72 hours
- **High severity**: Response within 48 hours, fix within 1 week
- **Medium severity**: Response within 1 week, fix within 2 weeks
- **Low severity**: Response within 2 weeks, fix within 1 month

## üèÜ Recognition

We believe in recognizing the contributions of security researchers:

### Hall of Fame
Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be:
- Listed in our security hall of fame (with permission)
- Credited in release notes for fixes
- Invited to join our security advisory team (for significant contributions)

### Responsible Disclosure
We follow responsible disclosure practices:
- We will not pursue legal action against researchers who follow our guidelines
- We request that you do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities until we have had time to address them
- We will work with you to understand and reproduce the issue
- We will keep you informed of our progress on fixing the issue

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Security Testing
Our CI/CD pipeline includes:
- **Dependency vulnerability scanning** with npm audit
- **Static code analysis** for security issues
- **Automated security tests** in our test suite
- **Container security scanning** for Docker images

### Manual Security Testing
We regularly perform:
- **Penetration testing** of critical components
- **Code reviews** with security focus
- **Authentication and authorization testing**
- **Input validation testing**

### Security Test Commands
```bash
# Run security audit
npm run security-audit

# Run security-specific tests
npm run test:security

# Check for vulnerable dependencies
npm audit

# Run all tests including security
npm test
```

## üö´ Out of Scope

The following are considered out of scope for security reports:
- **Social engineering attacks** against users or staff
- **Physical attacks** against infrastructure
- **Denial of Service attacks** that require excessive resources
- **Issues in third-party dependencies** (please report to the respective maintainers)
- **Self-XSS** that requires user interaction to execute malicious code
- **Issues that require physical access** to user devices

## üîß Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
Ensure these security-related environment variables are properly configured:

```env
# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=<strong-random-secret>

# Database Security
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<service-role-key>

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000  # 15 minutes
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100

# Security Headers
SECURITY_HEADERS_ENABLED=true
```

### Production Security Checklist
- [ ] HTTPS enabled and enforced
- [ ] Security headers configured (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] Error messages sanitized
- [ ] Debug mode disabled
- [ ] Sensitive data not logged
- [ ] Database access properly restricted
- [ ] Environment variables secured
